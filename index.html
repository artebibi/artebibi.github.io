    <h1 id="sectionHeading">About Bibiana</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <p id="aboutme">Born in Armero, Colombia in 1970, Bibiana Cervantes is an independent artist who has been working in different realms of the visual arts for over 20 years. Before moving to the United States, Bibiana received her Bachelor of Journalism Degree from University of La Sabana in Colombia and her Masters degree in Spanish language investigative reporting in FIU,and has since completed a variety of art courses in institutions such as the Florida International University and the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale.
      <br><br>
      Bibiana was the winner of the Chili’s Margarita Madness Design Contest in 2007 and the Wendy’s T-Shirt Design Contest in 2012. In addition to participating in national design contests, Bibiana has exhibited her work in numerous galleries and museums, such as the Museum of Coral Gables , MAC., Miami Art Central, Broward College, University of Connecticut, Alianza Francesa en Dubai, Instituto de cultura hispana-Houston Texas. Just to mention some.
      Through her extensive travels, Bibiana has made several different parts of the world the subjects for her photographs, highlighting the themes of individuality and environment within folk culture. Heavily contrasting with this traditional interpretation is Bibiana’s interest in modern abstract photography.
      <br><br>
      In her paintings, Bibiana focuses on both abstract and realistic works using acrylics and mixed media. Her abstract art is usually in the form of collage, typically using old letters, and her realistic art often features red heels and women’s legs. Bibiana explains the artistic process as being a meditative and transcendent experience that removes her from the trivialities of life and into a numinous state. Bibiana fashions what she sees and feels into a means of identity and hopes that others find their own identity through her work.</p>
